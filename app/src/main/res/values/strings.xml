    <string name="History">Evidence of preparing roasted duck in China goes as far back as the Southern and Northern dynasties (420-589). However, it wasnot until the Yuan dynasty (1271-1368) that the dish association with the imperial court was first recorded, in the form of a 1330 cookbook by a royal dietary physician by the name of Hu Sihui. Hu recipe called for a rather elaborate preparation,where the duck was roasted inside the stomach of a sheep.Interestingly, although Peking duck is named after Beijing (Peking is an older spelling), it originated in the former Chinese capital of Nanjing, which lies in the eastern province of Jiangsu. In the Ming dynasty, the imperial court moved to Beijing, bringing roasted duck along with it. By then, Peking duck was an established staple of imperial menus. In the Qing dynasty, Peking duck spread to the nobility, where the dish was much praised in the writings of scholars and poets.</string>
